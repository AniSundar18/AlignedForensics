# On the Effectiveness of Dataset Alignment for Fake Image Detection

Official repository of [On the Effectiveness of Dataset Alignment for Fake Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11835). The specific instructions for training the models and reproducing the plots can be found in the **training_code** and **testing_code** directories.

## Pretrained Models

Our pre-trained fake image detectors can be found below,
- [Ours](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ACoiwC8BM0NpyhAwbKsyAk1Da-TAoRRy/view?usp=sharing) (ResNet-50 trained without sync'd batches)
